Ideas to improve Lazygal (in no particular order)

* SMP support, perhaps using parallel python (http://www.parallelpython.com/)
  though not sure about its ability to transmit MakeObject.build. Perhaps
  os.fork() would be a better alternative.
    Work to be done mostly in lazygal/make.py

* Have some generic methods on LightWebalbumDir to provide metadata.

* Add some styles to the default theme.

* Delete half made stuff on KeyInterrupt
     Work to do to be mostly in lazygal/make.py but should uncover some bugs in
     output items computations.
