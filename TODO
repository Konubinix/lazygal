Ideas to improve Lazygal (in no particular order)

* SMP support, perhaps using parallel python (http://www.parallelpython.com/)
  though not sure about its ability to transmit MakeObject.build. Perhaps
  os.fork() would be a better alternative.
    Work to be done mostly in lazygal/make.py

* Have WebalbumIndexPage depend on subdir metadata file.

* Have some generic methods on LightWebalbumDir to provide metadata.

* Themes mostly through CSS : it is a pain to maintain multiple structure, and
  I'm sure using CSS and eventually 'display: none' for information we do not
  want in some themes, a high level of customization may be achieved. This
  would mostly involve :
    - merging default and image-index themes,
    - building a style sheets list,
    - adding a command line option the would be a synonym for
      '--template-var default-style=STYLE' and use this to not add 'alternate'
      to the 'rel' attribute of the stylesheet declaration.
    Work to do to be mostly in lazygal/generators.py, lazygal.py, themes

* Add some styles to the default theme.

* Make the contents of a feed item a template
